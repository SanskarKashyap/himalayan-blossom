i want to add a language switch button in the navigation bar. When the user clicks this button, the website’s content should switch from English to Hindi. That means:

All text currently displayed in English (headings, paragraphs, buttons, labels, etc.) will automatically be replaced with their Hindi translations.

The toggle button will act as a language switcher. For example:

Default: Hindi

On button click: English

Essentially, i want to implement multilingual support for my website, starting with English ↔ Hindi, controlled through a language toggle in the navbar.
